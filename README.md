This code includes a typescript that calls on a User-Identity to perform a blob snapshot task on storages/datalake within a particular tenant.

Presently, the managed identity is called using its Client ID and not its Principal Name; The Principal Name can be performed with a new service GraphProcessor.ts

Kindly reference the owner of this code when you use it. Thank You!
